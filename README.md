# Hammilton
I got intereseted in so-called Hammilton numbers. These numbers have some specific characteristics. 
What's more, there's a limited amount of them (mathematical proof) so I wihshed to generete at least some of them. 
It would be hardly impossible to iterate every number and check if they are or not Hammilton one, but I found it quite easier to generate using MultiSubSet Generating Algorithm. 
Then I check if they are prime or not. This way I found out that there are 7 prime Hammilton numners (o.txt). 

Of course it's useless, but so interesting!

It's one of my first Ruby code so it does not work as fast as I wish. Thus I made also a C++ version: it's faster (also based on a bit different algo), but not so beautiful.
